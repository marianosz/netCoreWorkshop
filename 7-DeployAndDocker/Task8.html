                                                <p>From the console, Build using release mode:
                                                    <code>dotnet build -c release</code></p>

                                                <p>Publish the application - this basically compiles the app's files into an output target, for copying onto a server
                                                    <code>dotnet publish -c release -o app</code></p>

                                                <p>We're specifying the output directory as 'app' here. This essentially made a folder, app, with the needed files, ready to be run. </p>

                                        <p>There are many options for deploying the package (/app) you now have. It's currently possible to deploy to Azure App Services very easily via local git repo. You can deploy in a container(s) to AWS Container Service
                                            very quickly. </p>

                                        <p>For now we're going to show one of the easiest and fastest ways to deploy - to Azure App Services via a local git repo. </p>

                                            <li>
                                                <p>Create a new Web App in Azure. Select 'Deployment Options' and Local Git as the source. Go back to the app's properties and copy the Git URL listed. Create 'Deployment Credentials' to deploy here from git. You can take advantage of the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs.aspx">Visual Studio Dev Essentials</a> subscription in order to get everything you need to build and deploy your app on any platform.</p>

                                                <p>Create a local git repo, and set the remote push repo to the above Azure app git URL,
                                                    <code>git remote add azure &lt;Azure app Git URL&gt;</code></p>

                                        <p>Then commit and and push to Azure, <code>git push -u azure master</code>. For more <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-deploy-local-git/">detailed instruction, see Microsoft's docs</a>.</p>

                                        <p>If you would like to use Docker in the devleopment process of your ASP.NET Core app, you can do so easily and it's great practice. You can build your own container to use, or use an existing one. Once you have a
                                            container running with the ASP.NET Core environment mounted to your souce code, you can do the workshop using Docker to build and run the app. </p>

                                            Build the container</h2>

                                        <p>Take a look at the Dockerfile in the HOL\7-DeployAndDocker\src\1 folder. This specifies what the container will have, and in this case, it's based on the latest public .NET Core image. Then it adds some configuration for
                                            ASP.NET. You can build the ASP.NET Core container from the provided Dockerfile, following these steps: </p>

                                        <ol>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>Get the contents of <code>Dockerfile</code> from the start folder in this section (or go to that folder), and run this command in the same directory as the file:</p>

                                                <pre><code>docker build -t netcore-webapp .</code></pre></li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>See that your image was created correct from the build step above, by listing the images on your machine, by typing <code>docker images</code>. You should see it in the list.</p>
                                            </li>
                                        </ol>

                                        <p>For instructions on how to quickly get started with Docker if you don't have it installed and haven't used it, take a look at this article, <a href="https://stormpath.com/blog/tutorial-deploy-asp-net-core-on-linux-with-docker">Deploy an ASP.NET Core Application on Linux with Docker</a>.</p>

                                        <p>You can use Docker Compose to spin up multiple containers at once, in order to create a multi-server environmnet. The most common example would be to spin up a container running the application, and a container

                                        <p>There is a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file in the HOL\7-DeployAndDocker\src\1 folder that use Docker Compose to spin up an ASP.NET Core container, and a postgreSQL container. We are going to use that folder to build
